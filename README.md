# handel-rs - Multi-Signature Aggregation in Large Byzantine Committees in Rust

This is a port of ConsenSys's Go implementation of the [Handel](https://github.com/ConsenSys/handel) protocol.

This code is still in development and is meant as a prototype to understand how the protocol works. It depends heavily on crates from [Nimiq](https://github.com/nimiq/core-rs) and will later be used for Nimiq's new PoS consensus algorithm [Albatross](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01589).
